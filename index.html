        <h2>About Formula 1</h2>
        <p>
          Formula 1, also known as F1, is the highest class of international
          single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale
          de l'Automobile (FIA). The World Drivers' Championship, which became
          the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981, has been one of the
          premier forms of racing around the world since its inaugural season in
          1950.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Formula One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands
          Prix, held worldwide on purpose-built circuits and public roads. The
          results of each race are combined to determine two annual World
          Championships, one for drivers and one for constructors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Formula 1 cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in
          the world, owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the
          generation of large amounts of aerodynamic downforce. The cars are
          capable of lateral acceleration in excess of 6 g in corners. The
          performance of the cars is highly dependent on electronics,
          aerodynamics, suspension, and tires. The formula has seen many
          evolutions and changes over the years, with the current regulations
          focusing on hybrid power units and sustainable technologies.
